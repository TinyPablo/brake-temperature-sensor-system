# 🧩 Brake Temperature Sensor System (BTSS)

An embedded system designed to monitor brake disc temperature using a **Raspberry Pi Pico** and a **K-type thermocouple (MAX6675 module)**.

The project is currently in **active development** — hardware setup and wiring are being prepared.

---

## 🔧 Current Development Stage

- Electrical layout designed and verified  
- Components ordered and tested individually  
- System wiring & first prototype assembly in progress  

---

## ⚙️ Planned Features

- Real-time brake disc temperature monitoring  
- Future integration with **OBD2** for live data logging  
- Correlation analysis between **braking behavior** and **engine braking**  
- Compact and filtered power system (12V → 5V) for clean sensor readings
